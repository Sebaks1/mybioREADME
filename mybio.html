<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>

    I'm Sebaks Seshothela, an aspiring software developer who is busy with 
    a bootcamp at HyperionDev. I have been working as a high school teacher 
    for the past 10 years. I got interested in tech after watching Tiktok 
    videos and also finding out that it is scarce skill in South Africa. I am
    life long who easily adapts to new environments

</p>
<p>

    I am planning to use my tech skills in the education space to solve 
    challenges that we encouter on a daily basis. Tech is easily scalable 
    which will allow me to reach learners across South Africa.

</p>
<p>
    I am very active on Tiktok with about 10k followers across my three 
    accouts. The Tiktok platform allows me to meet learners and people in 
    general from all spheres of life.
